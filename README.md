  **Significance**: Pancreatic cancer is one the world's deadliest cancer, where patients remain asymptomatic until a diagnosis at advanced stages, followed by a brutal degradation of quality of life.
  Surgery is, to date, the only curative option, but can only performed in the early stages of cancer progression. 
  While tremendous progresses have been accomplished in characterising the biology of the cancer, therapeutic gains have not materialised, in part because the _in vitro_ models currently used cannot accurately model the development of cancerous lesions.
  
 In this work, we have developed an _in vitro_ model of tumours that **faithfully** recreate the architecture of the lesions and that allows the observation **in real time** of the dynamics at play.
  This study represents a crucial step for our understanding of lesion formation and progression, and opens perspectives for the development and the testing of new therapies.

### "Coexisting mechanisms of luminogenesis in pancreatic cancer-derived organoids" **iScience** (2024) [\[Link\]](https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(24)01524-4)
  **S. Randriamanantsoa\***, M. Raich\*, D. Saur, M.Reichert, A. R. Baush

  **Significance**: Tumours, and the pre-cancerous lesions that precede them are not always solid masses of cells, but can possess internal cavities - "lumens" - in which fluid and material can circulate, in a fashion similar to the healthy lumens of exocrine glands in our bodies.
In the context of pancreatic cancer, understanding how those cavities emerge is therefore primordial to improve early diagnosis, identify mechanisms of cancer progression, and develop new therapies.
Using our architecturally-faithful _in vitro_ model of branched tumour organoids, we found that two complementary but orthogonal mechanisms of luminogenesis were at play, a phenomenon rarely observed in architecturally-simpler models such as spheroids. 
Organoids leveraged both fluid intake - nucleating microcavities and fracturing branches along a fault line -, and targeted cell death in the centre of the branches, to hollow out cavities.

This work further illustrates that an increased complexity in organoid architecture allows the emergence and the detection of rich morphogenetic events, and that in our attempts to recapitulate "function", we should also pay close attention not to neglect "form", as the two are often deeply intertwined.

# Code 

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.6577226.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6577226) 

In the Source Data folder, you can find examples of typical (academia!) code, here mainly used to load, clean, process, and visualise experiment data.
I use Jupyter notebooks for their transparency, reproducibility and ease of visualising. 
`pandas` was used for data manipulation while `matplotlib` and `seaborn` are used for the visualisation.

# Some additional talks 

In addition to talks strictly about my research topic, I also occasionally talks about broader issues in science during internal seminars. Here are some examples :   

* "ChatGPT and Large Langage Models in scientific writing - Before using Generative AI in your next manuscript" - E22/E27 Winter School 2024

The emergence of publicly-available large language models (LLMs) has garnered considerable attention, and some in the scientific community have been contemplating using those tools to write their next papers.
This talk explores the issues associated to this idea, notably the questions of copyright and licencing, of plagiarism, of confidentiality, and of responsibility that accompany the use of current LLMs.
I introduce examples and litigation cases, often outside of academia, to illustrate those issues.

* "Statistics done wrong" - E22/E27 Winter School 2023

Scientists love to use the words "statistically significant" or manipulate "p-values" to draw conclusions (!) about hypotheses. In most of the cases, this is done in a terribly wrong fashion, as has repeatedly been reported (see [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00857-9), [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/526182a), [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00874-8) or [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2016.19503)). Yet, the quest for 3 (or 4, or 5) stars of "significance" to put above barplots continues plaguing research.
The ambition of this talk is to illustrate how bad this can get, to get the audience to hopefully re-consider before carelessly using statistics in their next paper.
