  **Significance**: Pancreatic cancer is one the world's deadliest cancer, where patients remain asymptomatic until a diagnosis at advanced stages, followed by a brutal degradation of quality of life.
  Surgery is, to date, the only curative option, but can only performed in the early stages of cancer progression. 
  While tremendous progresses have been accomplished in characterising the biology of the cancer, therapeutic gains have not materialised, in part because the _in vitro_ models currently used cannot accurately model the development of cancerous lesions.
  
 In this work, we have developed an _in vitro_ model of tumours that **faithfully** recreate the architecture of the lesions and that allows the observation **in real time** of the dynamics at play.
  This study represents a crucial step for our understanding of lesion formation and progression, and opens perspectives for the development and the testing of new therapies.

# Code 

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.6577226.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6577226) 

In the Source Data folder, you can find examples of typical (academia!) code, here mainly used to load, clean, process, and visualise experiment data.
I use Jupyter notebooks for their transparency, reproducibility and ease of visualising. 
`pandas` was used for data manipulation while `matplotlib` and `seaborn` are used for the visualisation.
